Esport Administration Panel

This tool is a remnant of old times and is a simple administration tool for esport/sport organizations, including a file manager, match and event administration and press releases administration.
It gives you also the possibilty to assign tasks to your users/staff members and announce new things on the dashboard.

WARNING: This tool is just a part of an old version of a project. There might be some bugs and technical issues.
The new full version will be released in 2019.

Setting up the system:

#1
-------------------------------
Change following files first and replace them with your parameters:

- assets/configs/mysql.php,
- assets/configs/page.php,
- assets/configs/tokens.php -- The tool will not work without correct tokens.

#2
-------------------------------
Open the following URL:
http://[yoururl].[com]/install

--> This will create the MySQL tables and a default user.

Have fun!
